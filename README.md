# TwitchFestify
Bringing Festify to a Twitch Extension. Created by the PixelogicDev Subscriber Community.

## Welcome
Hello from the PixelogicDev Team on Twitch! This Team and project are brought to you by all the subscribers that have supported the PixeligcDev Twitch stream. This project is a place for all these supports to come together, build something resume worthy, and have a fantastic time doing it!

## What Are We Building?
TwitchFestify(NAME STILL PENDING) is a Twitch extension for playing, voting, and adding music real time on stream from viewers! We hope to implement a way to allow volume controls for each instance of this extension so viewers can adjust the audio on their stream instance. While this is the basis of our project, the features will evolve over time. Don't know what Festify or Twitch Extensions are? To learn more about Festify and Twitch Extensions take a look at these links:<br>

## Wait, Is This Project Open Source?
HECK YEA IT IS. During the initial building stage only PixelogicDev Subscribers(more to come on this) will be able to actively contribute. Once the extension is live, we encourage everyone to contribute to this project!

## Alright, I'm Sold. How Can I Get In On This?
